# cpu-scheduling-algorithms
Python implementation of 3 CPU scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF),and Round Robin (RR). and Average waiting time comparison between all 3.

TIP :- You can play around with Quantum size in Round Robin and check Results.
# FUTURE WORKS
1) Implementation of other scheduling algorithms.
2) Average waiting time over Random No of iterations of Random No of Processes.
